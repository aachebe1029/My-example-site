					Being the middle child, I had assumed that I would get support from my parents to become who I wanted to be growing up. I thought that I would get opportunities from them since they already had other kids who were starting their journey into being adults; I just wanted to follow in their footsteps and make the most of my life growing up in the US. However, being the middle child wasn’t the only mark that I had being born in this family. I was also the only girl among three boys and my parents were immigrants who still believed in gender norms and stereotypes. My parents believed in having the woman of the family learn to do housekeeping and cooking skills, while the boys had their whole lives to get a career and venture into different avenues that I wasn’t privy to. While my brothers were going to a Tech conference with their school, I was at home finding the next meal for their dinner. While they were trying out for sports, I was too busy rushing my homework to start the laundry. I was falling behind.<br>
